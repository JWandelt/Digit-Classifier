# Digit-Classifier
This is a very basic tool to recognize hand-drawn(by mouse) digits, using AI trained CNN model. By no means should it be used as any sort of guide in similar tasks.

# Setup
To setup the project, apart from installing all the necessary modules, you only have to run the script _**Setup.py**_ - it will check if CNN model is present and if not, it will train one.

# Usage
To use the project, run main.py. A window with three buttons will appear, where you can draw a digit(one at a time), erase and make predictions.
